# 🛡 Secure Code Wizard

A web app that analyzes code for security vulnerabilities and suggests safe versions using AI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Built with React.js frontend and Flask backend  
- Supports multiple languages (Python, JS, TS, C++, Java)  
- “Analyze Code” scans for vulnerabilities via backend  
- Displays security score + issues with line numbers  
- Generate Secure Code” uses OpenAI API to fix code  
- Secure output shown with copy-to-clipboard support  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

-  React.js (frontend UI)
-  Flask (Python backend)
-  Regex scanner for static vulnerability checks
-  OpenAI GPT API (secure code generation)
-  Axios for frontend-backend communication
-  Postman for API testing

---

## ⚙ Implementation Flow

-  “Analyze Code” sends code + language via POST to Flask
-  Flask sends input to scanner.py for regex vulnerability checks
-  Score + issues with line numbers returned to UI
-  “Generate Secure Code” triggers OpenAI GPT via backend
-  GPT returns rewritten secure version
-  Read-only textarea shows secure code with copy option
-  Backend tested using Postman (for JSON response validation)
